# External Creative Assets

Large WAN/Qwen/VibeVoice asset packs (datasets, LoRAs, Patreon workflows) are **not** stored in this repository.

Download the bundles from the original source (Patreon/Drive) and place them in this directory when needed:

```
pmoves/creator/resources/
  ADV_Patreon/
    datasets/
    wan2-1-loras/
    workflows/
```

Keep binaries (.safetensors, .png, .zip) out of Git to avoid ballooning the repo. Document the exact asset versions in `pmoves/creator/README.md` when you update local copies.
