# PMOVES v5 • ROADMAP
_Last updated: 2025-11-06_

## Vision
A production-ready, self-hostable orchestration mesh for creative + agent workloads across GPU boxes and Jetsons: **hybrid Hi‑RAG**, **Supabase Studio**, **n8n orchestration**, **Jellyfin publishing**, and **graph-aware retrieval**.

## Milestones
### M1 — Core Retrieval & Data Plane ✅

- Hybrid **Hi‑RAG Gateway v2** (vector+lexical alpha, warm Neo4j dict, optional Meili, admin stats) — implemented
- **Reranker** (FlagEmbedding BGE) with fusion, toggle via env — implemented
- **Retrieval‑Eval** harness, dashboard, and MRR/NDCG script — implemented
- **Supabase (stub)** Postgres + PostgREST — implemented; Full stack via CLI/compose — available
- **Approval inputs** (render‑webhook) and **Presign** (ComfyUI ↔ MinIO) — implemented

### M2 — Creator & Publishing 🚀 (current)

| Status | Deliverable | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ComfyUI ↔ MinIO Presign microservice | `services/presign/api.py` provides presigned PUT/GET/POST helpers for MinIO/S3. |
| ✅ | Render Webhook (Comfy → Supabase Studio) | `services/render-webhook/webhook.py` inserts submissions into `studio_board` with optional auto-approval. |
| 🚧 | Publisher (Jellyfin) | `services/publisher/publisher.py` consumes approval events and refreshes Jellyfin; dependency guards and envelope fallback landed; richer metadata/error reporting and auto‑link fallback are documented and partially scripted. |
| ✅ | Publisher telemetry & ROI rollups | `/metrics` feeds from `services/publisher/publisher.py` and `services/publisher-discord/main.py` expose turnaround/latency/cost telemetry, with Supabase rollups powering the ROI dashboards documented in `pmoves/docs/TELEMETRY_ROI.md`. |
| ✅ | PDF/MinIO ingestion | `services/pdf-ingest/app.py` pulls PDFs from MinIO, extracts text, forwards chunks, and emits ingest events. |
| ✅ | PMOVES.YT geometry smoke hardening | `services/pmoves-yt/yt.py` now signs Supabase requests with the service-role key and falls back to direct pack lookups so `make smoke` stays green. |
| ✅ | Cloudflare remote access profile | `cloudflared` Compose profile + `make up-cloudflare`/`make cloudflare-url` provide one-command WAN exposure for laptops and VPS hosts. |
| ⏳ | n8n flows (Discord/webhooks) | `n8n/flows/*.json` only define placeholder workflows; Supabase pollers and Discord actions must be configured. |
| ✅ | Health/Finance integrations (Wger + Firefly) | Supabase schemas created; event topics added (`health.metrics.updated.v1`, `finance.transactions.ingested.v1`); n8n flow stubs added; import via Public API/UI. |
| 🚧 | Jellyfin library refresh hook + Discord rich cards | Jellyfin refresh occurs in the publisher, and `services/publisher-discord` formats embeds, but published-event wiring and asset deep links remain. Automation activation plan logged in `pmoves/docs/SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. |

**Outstanding to close M2:**

- publisher metadata/envelope polish — namespace-aware filenames, dependency guards, fallback envelopes merged; monitor adoption and backfill historic assets if needed
- Supabase approval dashboards (studio board + videos) now live under `pmoves/ui/app/dashboard/*`; follow the usage notes in [SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#4-supabase-approval-dashboards-studio-board--videos) when routing reviewers
- add published-event Discord embeds via `content.published.v1`; execution plan staged in `SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- wire Supabase ROI dashboards to the new publisher telemetry rollups; document interpretation guidance alongside ROI reporting (**see `docs/TELEMETRY_ROI.md` for the latest walkthrough**).
- build the Supabase→Discord automation inside the n8n exports and track discrete workflow validation steps in the implementation log
- execute the Supabase → Agent Zero → Discord activation checklist (`pmoves/docs/SUPABASE_DISCORD_AUTOMATION.md`) and log the validation timestamp (see operational reminders captured in the implementation plan)
- integrate Wger + Firefly flows: set secrets, import flows, run smokes, and verify upserts/events
- CHIT EvoSwarm loop: enable controller, confirm `geometry.swarm.meta.v1` events; ensure pack selection by producers and pack_id persisted in constellation meta (gateway v2)
- PMOVES.YT SABR handling: prefer Invidious when needed; add Whisper transcript fallback in pipeline; update smokes accordingly.
- [ ] CI TODO — surface `make lint-packs` as the pack manifest linter prior to publish, blocking `kb.pack.published.v1` unless manifests validate.
- [ ] CI TODO — retrieval-eval persona gate must succeed (`persona.publish.request.v1` → `persona.published.v1`) with thresholds persisted to `pmoves_core.persona_eval_gates`.
- [x] v2 realtime DNS fallback (host‑gateway derivation) — 2025‑10‑19
- [x] v2‑GPU default Qwen reranker + env overrides — 2025‑10‑19
- [x] Meili lexical enabled by default via pmoves/.env.local — 2025‑10‑19

### Stabilization Sprint (Nov 6 → Nov 12, 2025)

Goals
- Unify object storage on Supabase Storage (S3) across services and smokes.
- Ensure all core stacks start cleanly after host restarts (Docker Desktop/WSL).
- Make smoketests deterministic and fast (reduce SABR/external flakiness).
- Restore observability parity (Loki/Grafana dashboards for API latencies/errors).

Done
- Storage unified; presign/render-webhook validated against Supabase S3.
- Invidious stabilized on host 3005; companion/HMAC keys stamped.
- Hi‑RAG v2 CPU/GPU up; core smoke PASS.

Planned
- Loki config upgrade to 3.1.x; hook to Grafana alerts; verify `/ready` 200.
- pmoves.yt: force offline transcript provider during smoke; broaden fallback; add stable IDs.
- Reranker: re‑enable GPU rerank and add test coverage.
- Document `/hirag/admin/stats` and Supabase‑only storage in service docs and SMOKETESTS.md.

### Stability & Release Hardening Initiative (Prep)

- **Repository & registry unification:** transfer POWERFULMOVES repos into the CATACLYSM-STUDIOS-INC org, mirror all GHCR images to `ghcr.io/cataclysm-studios-inc/*`, and update compose/env defaults (Wger now pulls from the new namespace).
- **Shared CI release workflow:** author a reusable GitHub Actions pipeline that lint/tests, builds multi-arch images, signs artefacts, and pushes to GHCR only on protected branches/tags; expose it via `workflow_call` so each repo inherits the same release gates.
- **Reproducible local builds:** standardise `make release` and `make build-stable` targets that wrap the CI scripts, pin toolchains (uv/poetry, corepack), and emit SBOMs + digests for operator verification.
- **Core change controls:** expand CODEOWNERS + branch protection so `pmoves/` and critical integrations require review, signed commits, and passing CI before merge; route docs/scripts to lighter paths so iteration stays fast.
- **Client generation from API specs:** use the checked-in docs (e.g., `pmoves/docs/services/wger/wger.yaml`) to generate typed SDKs for Agent Zero/n8n, ensuring downstream integrations track the published schema.
- **Timeline:** capture ownership + sequencing for these bullets in `NEXT_STEPS.md` and link the eventual CI workflow docs so testers can exercise the stabilized builds once the current improvements land.

### M3 — Retrieval Quality & Graph Enrichment

- Entity linking dictionaries (DARKXSIDE / POWERFULMOVES aliases) — alias sourcing tasks assigned in `SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Relation extraction (Entity —[REL]→ Entity) from captions/notes
- Reranker parameter sweeps + CI artifacts (toggle implemented) — prep checklist drafted in `SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Cross-namespace routing & intent-based type boosters

### M4 — Formats & Scale

- Office docs (DOCX/PPTX) → PDF conversion & index
- Image OCR lane (Tesseract), safety tagging, EXIF harvest
- Proxmox templates, GPU passthrough profiles, Tailscale policy bundles

### M5 — Studio & Ops

- Studio approval UI (Supabase Studio quick‑view + light admin)
- CI/CD: PR gates run retrieval‑eval; publish artifacts
- Backups (Proxmox Backup Server), snapshots, disaster drill

## Deliverables (current sprint)

- ✅ ComfyUI upload/presign microservice — deployed via `services/presign` FastAPI worker
- ✅ Render webhook — live handler in `services/render-webhook`
- ✅ Hi‑RAG reranker toggle + evaluation suite update — implemented (parameter sweeps still optional)
- 🚧 Jellyfin refresh + rich Discord embeds — waiting on publisher metadata polish and Discord wiring
- ✅ Roadmap/NEXT_STEPS — aligned with repo state (unified REST + single‑env + agent health)
- ✅ TensorZero gateway integration for LangExtract — gateway profile, Crush auto-detection, and observability metadata tags routed through `LANGEXTRACT_PROVIDER=tensorzero`.
- ✅ LangExtract Workers AI option + docs/env wiring — 2025-10-23
