Note: Consolidated plan index at pmoves/docs/PMOVES.AI PLANS/README_DOCS_INDEX.md.
_Last updated: 2025-10-14_

## Immediate

### Completed on 2025-10-19
- v2 Supabase Realtime DNS fallback (host‑gateway derivation from SUPA_REST_URL/SUPA_REST_INTERNAL_URL)
- v2‑GPU default Qwen reranker with env overrides; `make smoke-gpu` validated
- Meilisearch lexical enabled by default via `pmoves/.env.local` (USE_MEILI=true)
- Neo4j deprecation fix: replace `exists(e.type)` with `e.type IS NOT NULL` in v1 and v2 gateways

### 1. Finish the M2 Automation Loop
- [ ] Execute the Supabase → Agent Zero → Discord activation checklist (`pmoves/docs/SUPABASE_DISCORD_AUTOMATION.md`) and log validation timestamps in the runbook.
- [ ] Populate `.env` with Discord webhook credentials, perform a manual webhook ping, and capture the confirmation screenshot/log.
- [ ] Activate the n8n approval poller and echo publisher workflows once secrets are loaded; document the activation + first successful run.
- [x] Confirm Jellyfin credentials (API key and optional user id) allow library enumeration; use `make jellyfin-verify` before publisher smokes (2025-10-13). Re-ran on 2025-10-14 after populating `JELLYFIN_USER_ID=c26d57363bad4318a37c0bf8673c389c`.
- [x] Validate that enriched publisher metadata propagates into Agent Zero and Discord events; schedule a backfill for legacy records if fields are missing.
  - 2025-10-14: Agent Zero realtime listener (`python pmoves/tools/realtime_listener.py --topics content.published.v1 --max 1`) captured enriched payload, and `publisher-discord` delivered the Jellyfin-enriched embed to the mock webhook (see `docker logs mock-discord`).
- [ ] Record step-by-step evidence in `SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` while executing the operational reminders list.
- [ ] Health/Finance integrations (Wger + Firefly)
  - Compose profiles, watcher sidecar, and helper scripts now live directly in `pmoves/compose/` and `pmoves/scripts/`. Use the
    new `make integrations-*` targets and drop flow exports into `pmoves/integrations/**/n8n/flows/` to keep local n8n in sync.

### Using CHIT in Persona Prompts (New)
- Reference constellations by ID in prompts and call Agent Zero MCP `geometry.jump` to fetch locators for deep links.
- Example prompt fragment:
  - “Using constellation `health.adh.2025-10-06..2025-10-12`, summarize adherence trends and link to Jellyfin at each jump locator.”
- Evidence to capture:
  - Prompt text, constellation IDs, and resulting Discord embeds/links.

### 2. Jellyfin Publisher Reliability
- [x] Add a scheduled refresh or webhook trigger so Jellyfin libraries update after publisher runs; include cron/webhook settings in `services/publisher/README.md`.
- [ ] Expand error/reporting hooks so failures surface with actionable messages (Jellyfin HTTP errors, dependency mismatches, asset gaps).
- [ ] Backfill historic Jellyfin entries with enriched metadata and confirm downstream consumers (Agent Zero, Discord) render the new fields. Use `make demo-content-published` to emit a sample `content.published.v1` envelope and inspect the Discord embed plus Agent Zero realtime listener output (`python pmoves/tools/realtime_listener.py`) for `thumbnail_url`, `duration`, and Jellyfin deep links.

### 3. Graph & Retrieval Enhancements (Kickoff M3)
- [x] Wire the gateway `/mindmap/{constellation_id}` endpoint to Neo4j with seed + smoke coverage (2025-10-06).
- [ ] Seed Neo4j with the brand alias dictionary (DARKXSIDE, POWERFULMOVES, plus pending community submissions) and record Cypher script locations (draft plan in `SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`).
- [ ] Outline relation-extraction passes from captions/notes to candidate graph edges; define success metrics and owner in the project tracker.
- [ ] Prepare reranker parameter sweep plan (datasets, toggles, artifact storage) for integration into CI, aligning with the prep checklist captured in `SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and ensuring persona publish gating thresholds stay versioned.
  - Notes: Qwen default on GPU path is in place; sweeps should compare Qwen vs BGE vs Cohere/Azure on the real datasets under `services/retrieval-eval/datasets/` and publish artifacts.

### 4. PMOVES.YT High-Priority Lane
- [x] Add multi-model `youtube_transcripts` schema columns (MiniLM/Gemma/Qwen) and adapter config knobs (2025-10-23).
- [ ] Promote YouTube channel monitor prototype into core service (see `PMOVES.yt/CHANNEL_MONITOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`).
  - Scaffold FastAPI worker, Supabase migration, queue wiring, smoke tests.
  - 2025-10-23: Added queue status transitions + webhook callback + pytest coverage (`pytest pmoves/services/channel-monitor/tests`). Stack smoke pending.
  - 2025-10-23: Surfaced yt-dlp archive/caption/postprocessor knobs in env + channel configs.
- [ ] Launch PMOVES.YT personalization MVP (see `PMOVES.yt/USER_PREFERENCES_AND_INSIGHTS.md`).
  - Implement Supabase tables (`user_sources`, `user_engagement`, `tv_channels`).
  - Extend channel monitor ingest loop with per-user `yt_options` + credentials. _(In progress; DB schema + API endpoints merged.)_
  - Capture Jellyfin/PMOVES.TV events into engagement tables and surface baseline recommendations.
  - Provide default channel config + env vars; update docs once smoke passes.
- [ ] Implement PMOVES.YT summarization + resilient downloader backlog (Gemma endpoints, multipart upload, `make yt-smoke` helper).
- [ ] Design and document the resilient download module (resume, retries, rate limiting, playlist/channel ingestion, bounded worker pool).
- [ ] Specify multipart upload + checksum verification approach for MinIO, including lifecycle/retention tag configuration.
- [ ] Enumerate metadata enrichment requirements (duration, channel, tags, provenance) and map them to Supabase schema updates.
- [ ] Draft the faster-whisper GPU migration plan (language auto-detect, diarization flags, partial transcript updates) and confirm smoke expectations defined in `SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- [ ] Document Gemma integration paths: Ollama (`gemma2:9b-instruct`) and HF Transformers (`google/gemma-2-9b-it`), including feature toggles and embedding backstops.
- [ ] Define API hardening, observability, and security tasks (validation, OpenAPI, health/readiness probes, metrics, signed URL enforcement, optional content filters).

### 5. Platform Operations & Tooling
- [x] Publish Windows/WSL smoke scripts (`scripts/smoke.ps1`) with instructions in `pmoves/docs/LOCAL_DEV.md`.
- [x] Publish consolidated local tooling reference covering env scripts, Make targets, Supabase modes, and smoke workflows (`pmoves/docs/LOCAL_TOOLING_REFERENCE.md`), and link it from the root README.
- [x] Draft Supabase RLS hardening checklist covering non-dev environments and dependency audits (see `pmoves/docs/SUPABASE_RLS_HARDENING_CHECKLIST.md`, 2025-10-14).
- [x] Plan optional CLIP + Qwen2-Audio integrations, including toggles, GPU/Jetson expectations, and smoke tests (captured in `pmoves/docs/CLIP_QWEN_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, 2025-10-14).
- [ ] Outline the presign notebook walkthrough deliverable once automation stabilizes.

### 6. Realtime & Reranker Operational Notes (new)
- Realtime fallback is automatic; explicit override lives in `pmoves/.env.local`:
  - `SUPA_REST_URL=http://host.docker.internal:65421/rest/v1`
  - `SUPA_REST_INTERNAL_URL=http://host.docker.internal:65421/rest/v1`
  - `SUPABASE_REALTIME_URL=ws://host.docker.internal:65421/realtime/v1`
- Qwen reranker default (v2‑GPU) via compose env; override with `RERANK_MODEL` in `.env.local` if needed.
- Meili lexical is enabled via `USE_MEILI=true` in `.env.local`.

### 6. Grounded Personas & Packs Launch
- [ ] Apply `db/v5_12_grounded_personas.sql` plus geometry support migrations (`db/v5_12_geometry_rls.sql`, `db/v5_12_geometry_realtime.sql`); log analyze/vacuum runs and chosen embedding dimension in `SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- [ ] Update `.env` with reranker (`HIRAG_RERANK_ENABLED`), publisher (Discord/Jellyfin), and geometry toggles; capture restart evidence for gateway, workers, and geometry services.
- [ ] Seed baseline YAML manifests (`personas/archon@1.0.yaml`, `packs/pmoves-architecture@1.0.yaml`) and record publish commands plus resulting IDs in the runbook.
- [ ] Wire the retrieval-eval harness as a persona publish gate; store dataset locations, metric thresholds, and last-run results in `SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- [ ] Exercise the creator pipeline end-to-end (presign → webhook → approval → index → publish) and document emitted events (`kb.ingest.asset.created.v1`, `kb.pack.published.v1`, `persona.published.v1`, `content.published.v1`).
- [ ] Confirm geometry bus emissions (`geometry.cgp.v1`) populate the ShapeStore cache and note verification steps (API/CLI) in the runbook.
  - ✅ Baseline guardrail: the local smoke tests now ingest a signed CGP, assert the `/shape/point/{id}/jump` locator, and hit `/geometry/calibration/report`; failures will block `make smoke`.
  - Still needed: seed Supabase tables + Neo4j entities so ShapeStore warm-up stops warning about missing labels/keys, and capture the runbook evidence.
- [ ] Draft a CI-oriented pack manifest linter (selectors, age, size limits) and reference the proposal in `pmoves/docs/ROADMAP.md` once scoped.

## n8n Flow Operations
- **Importing**
  1. Open n8n → *Workflows* → *Import from File* and load `pmoves/n8n/flows/approval_poller.json` and `pmoves/n8n/flows/echo_publisher.json`.
  2. Rename the flows if desired and keep them inactive until credentials are configured.
- **Required environment**
  - `SUPABASE_REST_URL` – PostgREST endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` – used for polling and patching `studio_board` (grants `Bearer` + `apikey`).
  - `AGENT_ZERO_BASE_URL` – Agent Zero events endpoint base (defaults to `http://agent-zero:8080`).
  - `AGENT_ZERO_EVENTS_TOKEN` – optional shared secret for `/events/publish`.
  - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` – Discord channel webhook (flows post embeds here).
  - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_USERNAME` – optional override for the Discord display name.
- **Manual verification checklist**
  1. Insert a `studio_board` row with `status='approved'`, `content_url='s3://...'`, and confirm `meta.publish_event_sent_at` is null.
  2. Trigger the approval poller (activate or execute once) and confirm Agent Zero logs a `content.publish.approved.v1` event.
  3. Verify Supabase row updates to `status='published'` with `meta.publish_event_sent_at` timestamp.
  4. POST a `content.published.v1` envelope to the webhook (`/webhook/pmoves/content-published`) and confirm Discord receives an embed (title, path, artifact, optional thumbnail).
  5. Deactivate flows after testing or leave active with schedules confirmed.

## Backlog Snapshot

- [ ] Hit the publisher and publisher-discord `/metrics` endpoints and capture the turnaround/latency summary for the runbook.
- [ ] Confirm Supabase `publisher_metrics_rollup` and `publisher_discord_metrics` rows are created with engagement + cost payloads and link the ROI dashboard query.
- [ ] Record step-by-step evidence in `SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` while executing the operational reminders list.

### 2. Jellyfin Publisher Reliability
- [x] Add a scheduled refresh or webhook trigger so Jellyfin libraries update after publisher runs; include cron/webhook settings in `services/publisher/README.md`.

- [ ] Backfill historic Jellyfin entries with enriched metadata and confirm downstream consumers (Agent Zero, Discord) render the new fields.
- [ ] Plot baseline ROI visuals (turnaround vs engagement vs cost) using the Supabase rollup tables and incorporate the guidance captured in `TELEMETRY_ROI.md` into the dashboard notes.

### 3. Graph & Retrieval Enhancements (Kickoff M3)
- [x] Wire the gateway `/mindmap/{constellation_id}` endpoint to Neo4j with seed + smoke coverage (2025-10-06).

- [x] Draft Supabase RLS hardening checklist covering non-dev environments and dependency audits (see `pmoves/docs/SUPABASE_RLS_HARDENING_CHECKLIST.md`, 2025-10-14).
- [x] Normalize Supabase CLI endpoints for containers (`SUPA_REST_INTERNAL_URL`) so render-webhook, extract-worker, and geometry bus stay online after stack restarts; smoke harness verified on 2025-10-12. `make up` now auto-runs Supabase + Neo4j bootstraps so DB and mind-map seeds refresh each time.
- [x] Seeded `public.archon_prompts` via `supabase/initdb/09_archon_prompts.sql` + `10_archon_prompts_seed.sql` and mirrored CHIT geometry tables in `11_chit_geometry.sql` so Archon local stacks stay aligned with migrations (2025-10-13).

- [x] Plan optional CLIP + Qwen2-Audio integrations, including toggles, GPU/Jetson expectations, and smoke tests (captured in `pmoves/docs/CLIP_QWEN_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, 2025-10-14).
- [ ] Outline the presign notebook walkthrough deliverable once automation stabilizes.

### 6. Grounded Personas & Packs Launch
- [ ] Apply `db/v5_12_grounded_personas.sql` plus geometry support migrations (`db/v5_12_geometry_rls.sql`, `db/v5_12_geometry_realtime.sql`); log analyze/vacuum runs and chosen embedding dimension in `SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- [ ] Update `.env` with reranker (`HIRAG_RERANK_ENABLED`), publisher (Discord/Jellyfin), and geometry toggles; capture restart evidence for gateway, workers, and geometry services.

- [ ] Wire the retrieval-eval harness as a persona publish gate; store dataset locations, metric thresholds, and last-run results in `SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- [ ] Exercise the creator pipeline end-to-end (presign → webhook → approval → index → publish) and document emitted events (`kb.ingest.asset.created.v1`, `kb.pack.published.v1`, `persona.published.v1`, `content.published.v1`).
- [ ] Confirm geometry bus emissions (`geometry.cgp.v1`) populate the ShapeStore cache.
  - Watch the `hi-rag-gateway-v2` startup logs for `ShapeStore warmed with … Supabase constellations` once the Supabase tables are seeded.
  - Hit `$SUPA_REST_URL/geometry_cgp_packets?select=created_at&order=created_at.desc&limit=5` (or the fallback `constellations` query if the packets view is absent) to verify PostgREST is returning the rows used for cache warm-up. `make smoke-geometry-db` now automates the baseline check against `constellations`, `shape_points`, and `shape_index`.
  - Use `python pmoves/tools/realtime_listener.py` (or the `/geometry/` UI) to confirm realtime `geometry.cgp.v1` broadcasts continue to refresh the cache after boot.
