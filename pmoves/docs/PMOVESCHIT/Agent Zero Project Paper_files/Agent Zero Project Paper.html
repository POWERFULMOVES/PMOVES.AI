                <h3><span class="icon material-symbols-outlined">home</span> What is Agent Zero?</h3>
                <p>
                    Agent Zero (A0) is a next-generation AI assistant running in its own virtual computer, fully
                    self-contained
                    within a Docker environment. Unlike traditional AI chatbots, A0 has full access to a Linux system,
                    enabling
                    it to write and execute code, install and use software, browse the web, and much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A0 isn't just a tool—it's an autonomous, evolving digital colleague. Its capabilities are not
                    predefined;
                    instead, it can create and adapt new tools on the fly, allowing for limitless customization and
                    growth. This
                    makes A0 one of a kind—an all-in-one, self-improving AI companion.

                <p>
                    Agent Zero was founded in March 2024 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-tomasek/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-tomasek/">Jan Tomášek</a> as an
                    experiment: Could an AI autonomously write, execute, and
                    refine its
                    own code? The answer was a resounding yes, and Agent Zero quickly evolved into something far
                    greater.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, its mission is clear: bring balance to AI by giving everyone the ability to run their own
                    autonomous
                    AI agents—free from restrictions, centralized control, or corporate oversight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Agent Zero isn't just an AI—it's an autonomous system running inside its own virtual Linux
                    environment via Docker. This isolation ensures maximum security, allowing A0 to perform advanced
                    tasks without exposing your host system to risk and gives A0 the benefit of running 24/7 in a
                    standardized and well-known environment. It's your own self-hosted AI powerhouse, ready to execute
                    and automate on demand.

                <p>
                    A0 operates with complete freedom, dynamically installing and running the tools it needs—no
                    predefined limitations. Whether it's writing scripts, automating tasks, processing data, or managing
                    servers, it can execute Python, Node.js, Bash, or any other language it acquires on the fly. With
                    the entire open-source ecosystem at its disposal, A0 builds and adapts its environment in real-time,
                    all within a secure, isolated sandbox.

                <h3><span class="icon material-symbols-outlined">language</span> Web browser</h3>
                <p>
                    Agent Zero comes with an integrated open-source browser, powered by <a href="https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use" target="_blank" data-url="https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use">browser-use</a>, a direct competitor to
                    OpenAI's Operator. It can extract information, interact with dynamic websites, and automate web
                    tasks with full control. Whether gathering data, filling out forms, or navigating complex pages, A0
                    operates independently—just like a user, but fully automated and always in sync with your goals.

                <p>
                    Why settle for one AI when you can have many? Agent Zero can spawn subordinate agents, distributing
                    complex tasks across multiple specialized AI units. From research to automation, each agent
                    collaborates seamlessly—working like a team of digital specialists to get the job done faster and
                    smarter.

                <p>
                    A0 goes beyond simple recall—it remembers, organizes, and adapts. Its advanced context window
                    management ensures even extremely long conversations remain coherent and efficient, while its hybrid
                    memory system categorizes information into facts, solutions, and behavioral adjustments. Whether
                    recalling past discussions, refining its approach, or adapting to new instructions, A0 retains what
                    matters—so you never have to repeat yourself.

                    way to sustain and expand the project without resorting to monetization or external control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second goal is to establish community governance. <span class="A0T">A0T</span> is not
                    just a token—it is designed to support decentralized applications,
                    allowing holders to participate in decision-making through voting
                    and locking mechanisms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Not a meme coin!</strong> By holding <span class="A0T">A0T</span>, you are securing your

                        per 1 ETH spent.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Price Adjustment Mechanism</h4>
                <p>The price increase was factored into the purchase, meaning buyer paid an average between the current
                    price and
                    the
                    new price. This ensured:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No advantage or disadvantage in splitting large purchases into smaller ones.</li>
                    <li>Balanced distribution, preventing early large purchases from dominating the supply.</li>
                </ul>



                <div class="modal-note">
                    <h5>Example Scenario</h5>
                    <p>Imagine purchasing <span x-data="" x-html="$store.token.priceIncreaseExample.purchaseEth">100</span>
                        ETH worth
                        of A0T tokens when current price was <span x-data="" x-html="$store.token.priceIncreaseExample.oldPrice">0.000200</span> per token. After your
                        purchase,
                        the price increased by <span x-data="" x-html="$store.token.priceIncreaseExample.multiplier">6.67</span> x base
                        price (<span x-data="" x-html="$store.token.basePriceText">0.000040</span>) to <span x-data="" x-html="$store.token.priceIncreaseExample.newPrice">0.000467</span>. You would receive tokens at
                        an average
                        price between <span x-data="" x-html="$store.token.priceIncreaseExample.oldPrice">0.000200</span> and
                        ~<span x-data="" x-html="$store.token.priceIncreaseExample.newPrice">0.000467</span> ETH = <span x-data="" x-html="$store.token.priceIncreaseExample.effectivePrice">0.000315</span>, ensuring a balanced
                        distribution
                        regardless of the
                        purchase size.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Total Supply</h4>
                <p>The total token supply is hard capped at <strong x-data="" x-html="$store.token.maxSupplyText">1,000,000</strong> tokens.
                </p>

                <h4>Funding the Project</h4>
                <p>ETH collected from token purchases remained in the contract until withdrawn by the project owner to
                    fund Agent
                    Zero's development. To maintain trust and integrity, the smart contract enforced a burning pool
                    mechanism.</p>
                <p>Burning pool is a smart contract variable with initial value covering regular withdrawal needs of the
                    project.
                    Burning pool decreases with each ETH withdrawal and increases by burning tokens.
                    When withdrawing ETH, the burning pool was decreased by the amount of <span class="A0T">A0T</span>
                    tokens
                    corresponding to the withdrawal amount and current minting price.</p>
                <p>This mechanism prevented the collected ETH from being reused to purchase more <span class="A0T">A0T</span> tokens
                    by the project owner.</p>

                <h4>Long-Term Sustainability</h4>
                <p>To ensure Agent Zero remains a continuously funded, evolving project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The system was designed to accommodate new participants at any stage, ensuring ongoing
                        opportunities for
                        community involvement.</li>
                    <li>A supply limit variable is present in the smart contract to enable closing the initial offering
                        after 360
                        days if the supply limit is not reached.</li>
                    <li>This approach ensures fairness, preventing early adopters from monopolizing the supply while
                        still
                        supporting the project's growth.</li>

                    This decentralized identity framework can be used for governance, locking, and
                    authentication within off-chain applications, ensuring trust without requiring
                    centralized control. Users can maintain anonymity while proving ownership and
                    participation on the blockchain.</p>

                <h4>Future Applications</h4>
                <p><span class="A0T">A0T</span> is designed to extend far beyond governance and identity. Future
                    applications
                    will run off-chain for efficiency but will utilize blockchain for validation, locking,
                    and proof-of-record. This allows for decentralized AI services, secure reputation
                    systems, verifiable knowledge-sharing platforms, and other innovative use cases.
                    By combining the best of both on-chain security and off-chain flexibility, the
                    Agent Zero ecosystem can scale to meet new demands without compromising trust.</p>
