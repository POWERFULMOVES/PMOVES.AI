# AGNOTE4482PHI.t1

GRAPHITI_MARK: `PHI-4482-T1::THREE-BODY-CONVERGENCE::PMOVES`

## Purpose
Single coordination note to prevent agent collision while PMOVES.AI converges CI, docs, integrations, and production hardening strategy.

## Elder Connector
`LADY P` acts as the Grandma connector persona:
- provides smooth pre-flight context and reminders to any agent entering a lane
- preserves continuity ("grams to grams") across handoffs
- does not override claim ownership or merge controls

## Three-Body Solution
### Body 1: Delivery Body (Execution Lane)
- Owner: active implementation agent for the current branch/PR.
- Scope: code changes, workflow fixes, merge order, validation commands.
- Rule: one owner per branch at a time; no parallel edits to the same branch without explicit handoff.

### Body 2: Control Body (Governance Lane)
- Owner: orchestration/review agent.
- Scope: merge sequencing, risk controls, branch pruning policy, doc parity.
- Rule: no merge without up-to-date status in this note and PR comments.

### Body 3: Memory Body (Cipher + CHIT Lane)
- Owner: memory/security agent.
- Scope: CHIT-safe coordination payloads, encrypted handoffs, signature trail, agent state continuity.
- Rule: all cross-agent handoffs are posted as CHIT payload references, never plaintext secrets.

## Collision-Avoidance Protocol
1. Claim: agent writes `CLAIM` entry with branch + scope + TTL.
2. Work: agent updates progress in PR comments and this note.
3. Handoff: agent publishes CHIT payload reference and signs ACK block.
4. Release: agent writes `RELEASE` entry and clears claim.

## CHIT Encrypt Instructions (Handoff Safe Mode)
Use CHIT export with no cleartext, then reference artifact paths in handoff notes.

```powershell
make -C pmoves chit-export CHIT_NO_CLEARTEXT=1
make -C pmoves chit-manifest-sync
make -C pmoves secrets-funnel-sync
```

Optional CLI path:

```powershell
python -m pmoves.tools.mini_cli secrets encode --no-cleartext
```

Required handoff fields:
- `graphiti_mark`
- `branch`
- `pr_numbers`
- `scope`
- `risks`
- `next_actions`
- `chit_artifact_path`
- `agent_signature`

## Active Claim Register
- `2026-02-20T12:12:35.7340973-05:00` CLAIM `CODEX-GPT5` scope: PR convergence + runner/cache/app strategy review.

## Agent ACK (Signed)
- Agent: `CODEX-GPT5`
- Ack: `I acknowledge control of the current convergence lane and will not overlap branch edits without explicit handoff.`
- Signature: `ACK::CODEX-GPT5::PHI-4482-T1`
- Timestamp: `2026-02-20T12:12:35.7340973-05:00`
